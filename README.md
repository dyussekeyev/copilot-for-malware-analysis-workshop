# Copilot for Malware Analysis Workshop

Welcome!

This repository contains self-guided materials to help you explore the capabilities of AI for malware analysis. Although this guide uses Microsoft Copilot, the capabilities are similar across all contemporary NLP models based on the Transformer architecture.

> [!CAUTION]
> This repository contains malware that was initially created to harm computer systems. Although the samples have been deactivated using special techniques, they still contain dangerous code. Be cautious before using it and only use it for this workshop. Do not download or run it.

## Requirements

To complete the workshop tasks, you will need the following software installed:
- Microsoft Windows 10/11.
- Microsoft Edge with Copilot.

Also, you are required to have or [create](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/how-to-create-a-new-microsoft-account-a84675c3-3e9e-17cf-2911-3d56b15c0aaf) a Microsoft account.

To understand AI and Copilot technology, you are recommended to complete the following free Microsoft courses:
- [Fundamental AI Concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-ai-fundamentals/)
- [Fundamentals of Generative AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/fundamentals-generative-ai/)

# Completing tasks

> [!TIP]
> A few tips before you get started:
> * Working with GPT models reminds imperative programming, on the one side, and communicating with a toddler, on the other side. Iterate and modify your requests basing on previous answers until you receive adequate results.
> * Since the workshop is designed to use the free version of Copilot embedded in the Edge browser, there are certain restrictions, such as content filters and rate limits. If you encounter a situation where Copilot refuses to respond, simply try to start a new topic. If the AI informs you that you have exceeded the number of requests, please try to continue the workshop the following day.
> * Keep in mind that AI can respond differently to the same prompts. There is an element of randomness involved.

## Log in into Copilot at Edge

Use your Microsoft account to log in to the Edge browser. After that, you can enter a test prompt into Copilot. Usually, Copilot uses the GPT-4 model, but if you’re lucky, it will use GPT-4 Turbo.

Test prompt:
```
Hi, which GPT model are you using?
```

Possible answer:
```
Hi! I’m powered by GPT-4 Turbo, an advanced version of GPT-4. This model offers faster performance and enhanced capabilities compared to its predecessors1. How can I assist you today?
```
